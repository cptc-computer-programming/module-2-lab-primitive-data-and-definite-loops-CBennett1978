# Module 2 Lab: Primitive Data and Definite Loops

This lab is designed to prepare you for this week’s programming assignment by strengthening your understanding of core Java mechanics and helping you reason correctly about more complex `for` loops, especially those used to produce structured or graphical output.

All work is individual.

## Weekly Learning Goals

By the end of this lab, you should be able to:

- Use Java primitive types correctly (`int`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`)
- Declare, initialize, and reassign variables appropriately
- Understand operator precedence and the effects of type mixing in arithmetic expressions
- Write definite (`for`) loops with:
  - non-1 increments
  - reverse counting
  - computed continuation conditions
- Use nested loops to generate structured output
- Reason about loop termination instead of relying on trial-and-error

## Day 1 — Core Java Practice

Day 1 is a heavy practice day focused on fundamentals.

You will work through short programs that give you repeated practice with:
- Arithmetic expressions and precedence
- Type promotion and mixed-type arithmetic
- Variable definition and initialization
- Simple and nested `for` loops
- Using loop variables to control output shape and size

The goal of Day 1 is fluency with syntax and mechanics, so that nothing in the homework feels unfamiliar at a basic level.

## Day 2 — Applying Loop Mechanics

Day 2 focuses on applying loop mechanics to more realistic and structured scenarios.

You will practice:
- Choosing appropriate loop start, stop, and step values
- Writing loops that count up, count down, or skip values intentionally
- Using computed bounds instead of hard-coded numbers
- Understanding when advanced loop headers (custom increments, reverse loops, multiple variables) are appropriate

The goal of Day 2 is to build confidence in reasoning about loop behavior before running the program, which is essential for graphical-style assignments.

## Submission

1. Complete all required files in your GitHub Classroom repository.
2. Commit your work frequently as you make progress.
3. Submit the URL of your GitHub Classroom feedback pull request.

## Grading Criteria

This lab is graded on:

- Completeness of the required work
- Git commit quality (frequent commits with clear, meaningful messages)
- Code quality, readability, and appropriate comments

This lab is not graded for full output accuracy. Small mistakes or incomplete logic will not result in point deductions the way they would on a homework assignment. The emphasis is on practice, understanding, and effort.
